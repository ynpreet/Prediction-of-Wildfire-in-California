Predicting Wildfire in CA using weather data 

Collected the weather data based on fire history. Dataset is CSV form and originally includes over 70000 observations. 
Chose the nearest weather location from each fire history data point using Euclidean distance and 
selected 15 days before from the exact fire date. 
Utilized 1 unsupervised model and 2 supervised model: K-means, KNN and Logistics Ression. 
Compared accuracy and error rates of each model and found unsupervised model performed well for predicting the wild fire. 
Selected different variables to increase the accuracy of prediction. 
Used Python to obtain county information and R for data preprocessing and data analysis.
